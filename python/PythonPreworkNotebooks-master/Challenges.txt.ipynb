    "    Write a program that switches the value of two variables 'a' and 'b'\n",
    "    hint: you can use temporary variables to hold values\n",

    "Challenge 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write a program that has one variable 'n = 7', that checks to see if n is less than 5. if n IS NOT less than 5,\n",
    "    it should check to see if n is not greater than 8. if that is true then it should say 'the value is less than 8'\n",

    "\n",
    "    Write a program that converts the string 'abcabc' into the list ['ab', 'ab'] and print it to the\n",

    "    Write a program that loops to a range of 1000 but only prints the number its on every 100 loops until its done\n",
    "    hint: use a counter variable that keeps track of every loop, and reset the value when it prints. After the loop\n",
    "    it should print 'Done'\n",

    "\n",
    "    Write a program that IGNORES an exception and 'PASSES' to print 'it worked' at the very end, after the exception\n",
    "    Hint: the 'pass' keyword tells our interpreter to ignore and 'pass' over our code\n",
